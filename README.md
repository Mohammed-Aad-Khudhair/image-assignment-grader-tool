The application enables teachers to automatically compare student-generated images against expected results using a wide range of evaluation metrics. It supports applying masks or regions of interest (ROIs) to focus grading on specific areas of an image. Rules can be created, managed, and exported directly through the graphical interface, eliminating the need to write them manually, making the tool more user-friendly and efficient for preparing and running student tests.
